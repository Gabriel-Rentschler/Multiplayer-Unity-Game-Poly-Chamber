# Poly-Chamber
This game is very experimental and usually have features that I would like to know how they work.

The game right now is basically a playground for playing with objects with physics and a build mode, where you can anchor objects onto the ground. Objects also can be customized with colors and opacity.

I plan on adding more things so if you want to keep an eye here is the Trello that I'm using:

## HOW TO PLAY

The game right now just has a multiplayer mode, so you'll need to run the server too. On the releases there is the latest version for the client and the server.

Once downloaded, you can run the server executable and the client executable. On the client you can put the IP Address as 127.0.0.1 and put your username to connect. On any other machine on your local network (or a virtual network through Radmin) you can just put the host machine IP on the other clients to connect and play.

## CONTROLS

 - Fly mode: While in fly mode, you can press *SPACEBAR* to go up, or *LEFT SHIFT* to go down; (Pressing *F*)
 - Menu of items to spawn; (Pressing *Q*)
 - Pressing *C* the gun in your hand will iterate between two modes: 
     - Construction Mode: In this mode with the *middle mouse button* (pressing the mouse wheel) you can copy a object that you're pointing at, with the *left mouse button* you can paste the object you copied, and with the *right mouse button* you can delete a object;
     - RGB Mode: In this mode you can *left click* on your mouse in the object you're pointing at to change it's color, a screen on the right of the object will appear for you to change the red, green, blue and alpha of the object;
     - Grid Mode: With the Construction Mode selected, pressing *TAB* will enable the Grid Mode, which just locks the object you spawn in a grid, the object will not have physics. (good for fixed building). When in Grid Mode you'll see an arrow indicating where the object is facing, pressing *R* will rotate the object in one axis and pressing *E* will rotate in another axis.
