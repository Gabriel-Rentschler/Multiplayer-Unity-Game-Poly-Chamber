# Poly-Chamber
This game is very experimental and usually have features that I would like to know how they work.

The game right now is basically a playground for playing with objects with physics and a build mode, where you can anchor objects onto the ground. Objects also can be customized with colors and opacity.

I plan on adding more things so if you want to keep an eye here is the Trello that I'm using:

## HOW TO PLAY

The game right now just has a multiplayer mode, so you'll need to run the server too. On the releases there is the latest version for the client and the server.

Once downloaded, you can run the server executable and the client executable. On the client you can put the IP Address as 127.0.0.1 and put your username to connect. On any other machine on your local network (or a virtual network through Radmin) you can just put the host machine IP on the other clients to connect and play.
